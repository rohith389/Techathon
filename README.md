# Techathon
Developed a responsive single-page Hospital EMR dashboard using React 18, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Built modules for patient management, bed tracking, oxygen monitoring (with simulated real-time updates), and staff scheduling. Configured Vite for fast development and production builds, and prepared the app for backend integration via Supabase.
